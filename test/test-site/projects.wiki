Projects? Purposes? Motivations? Intentions? 

It's something that is trying to coalesce.
Into one thing, or one thing several ways, or the same thing one way...

At any rate, it's made out of something and you throw that something in a box. Seriously.
Throw it in a box, and rummage through it when you feel like getting to work on your
project and shove it in an attic if you're not quite ready to let go of it and you can set
it fire if you want to and you won't get guilted about any option, because it can allllll
come back....

Let's think about the box, a bit. The nice thing about a box is that it tells you how much
it holds, first, right when you're getting to know each other. An empty box signals what
it can hold. It's volume is in the definition of its form. A [[box]] doesn't have hidden
functions, it can't deceive you much about what weight it can bear. 

So what will our boxes be like? 

"Docker, For Files"

What the fuck does that mean? It means nothing. It's elevatorese. And yet. Every new thing
gives me new ideas, and it's open source and that makes me happy. Let's keep making open
source utilities until we figure out a way to make utilities [[open source]], okay?
