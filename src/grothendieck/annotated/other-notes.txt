Annotator requires jQuery and an implementation of JSON.parse and JSON.stringify. In short, the quickest way to get going with annotator is to include the following in the <head> of your document (paths relative to the repository root):

<script src='lib/vendor/jquery.js'></script>
<script src='lib/vendor/json2.js'></script>

<script src='pkg/annotator.min.js'></script>
<link rel='stylesheet' href='pkg/annotator.min.css'>
You can then initialize Annotator for the whole document by including the following at the end of the <body> tag:

<script>
  $(document.body).annotator()
</script>
See demo.html for an example how to load and interact with plugins.
