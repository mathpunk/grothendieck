I'm writing this linearly through a bit of an act of will. When I get to the end of a
longish thought, my eyes jump back up to the menubar. I think about backtracking through
where I have been. 

But what if I moved forward? 

They say the web is changing our brains. Damn skippy. Plasticity is your friend. But you
don't want to be hard plastic, bent to one set of fully branded data spearfishermen
hunting technique and then affixed there.

You wanna be silly putty about it. Smear things. Make a mess. Waste material in the hopes
of finding $David underneath this ((word, which I expand on, by telling the story of Jeme
with the electronic amplifier at The Generator.))

The point of my rambling splurgles of imagery is to talk about, not why I think that text
is broken, but what my research has led me to believe is antifragile about text. What
properties did it have, latent, that are vibrating loudly enough to hear now that they
thrum across the entire worldglobe.
