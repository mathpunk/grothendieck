Hypertext is the fibre bundle of one speaker's role in a conversation. 

Or it can be. See? It looks like this...


;; take a blog post 
;; expand its structure and filter it
;; expand its style and filter it
;; highlight the links
;; rotate the thing in three dimensions
;; show that there is a hairbrush to the other documents
;; do something similar to the natural language words
;; follow down the hole asynchronously for a while
;; pre render that ffs



I mean, it looks like code that does that. I don't have time for this, I've got [[projects]]
dammit!
