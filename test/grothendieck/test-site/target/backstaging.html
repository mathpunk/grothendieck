But I don't want to define them in html, Iwant them to just be "structure". This is probably what it's like to know LaTeX wellenough to get work in it. But, I want to get in the modern style: there can betransitions, multimedia, animation, and the like. And I want to do this to create aneffect: I want text to move through time and appearance to create an effect.It's a freaking improv show! There are writers and editors and readers and associates,there is the editing context and the annotating context and the marking context and suchmotivations, there are actions and you'd <em>think</em> there are reactions but you can't thinkof them that way, they are their own actions, but in someone else's control. So theaction-reaction thing, that's left to the construction of some rx-style or channel-style.Or, better yet, ignored. Why start with an interactive show when you can just present thestaged documents and let the reaction come through ordinary protocols? Why you gotta be sodamn needy?Well, because that's the medium of this era. It's supposed to be so very reactive. Well,we're going to have some reactivity in this annotations thing, and someone else did allthe work. Just bake it in, keep learning your server side, and work really hard on writingover the next 3 days. You've had a good break of practice. Quick, implement your thingbefore there's no time!</p></div></body></html>
