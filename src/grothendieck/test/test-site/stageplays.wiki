Right before you get stage-conscious you just put yourself back on track with a,

"Well what do I *want* to do?"

If you want to do something, and something's in the way, that's one thing. That ought to
be in the text of the play, it's what your material is with which to play.

But if you want to do something, and you're not doing, you have a sudden fractaling of
questions which all lead to interesting places. And isn't that the trick? You know that
every path you choose will go somewhere interesting, and so you do not have to worry about
which one to choose. It is probably the only time that you can have fully meaningful and
emotional experiences in which it is essentially meaningless what choices you make for
your lifetime -- remember that characters only live for minutes, a few hours tops if they
make it into an opera.  In order to have anything like a normal life they'd really have to
have their own long-running and beloved television series.

A cheaper alternative to writing stageplays is to write in [[the first person]].
