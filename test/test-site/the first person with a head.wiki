character: Some goner, I dunno
topic: stage, narration, first person, headers
publish?: sure

I'm typing this thing up, and so, I require some background information. Unless a
dramaturge has something to read so as to place me, I'm a goner. (I'm a character, you
see, and I don't have much time.)

So I'm going to write exactly what I just wrote, but with a trick.


I've added some stuff called header data to the top. It's bracketed by the triple hyphens
to tell the process that there's a header here.

I can imagine there being invalid data, but I bet this will throw an error anyway if that
comes up soon.

So, you might want to throw this function, but you would not write a catch until later.

Okay. I'm ready. I know that I've had my say, and I just wanted to add th[[links are important]]
